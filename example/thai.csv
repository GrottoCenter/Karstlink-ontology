A concrete path and steps descend the initial slope of large boulders for a few metres. From the entrance the cave drops steeply with a boulder floored passage which is up to 50m wide and 30m high. There isn't a fixed route up and down this boulder scramble, with seemingly a different route taken each time. Only 70m from the entrance, by ascending the slope on the left hand wall one reaches the start of the Entrance Series. This is a passage averaging 2 to 3m wide and 5m high that reaches a boulder floored chamber after 100m. Straight ahead the passage chokes, but there is a way on low down on the right that ascends for 100m to a choke. Taking the left hand branch at the end of the boulder chamber leads into the main part of the series. It consists of narrow rifts which loop back to the start of the Entrance Series (via a 5m pitch), to an alcove overlooking the Main Entrance and a high, ascending rift that is higher than the Main Entrance. - The Main Passage stays big and impressive for about 300m until it levels out and narrows into a rift. On the left a 2m high climb into a low bedding plane soon closes down. After another 25m the top of a 7m pitch is reached at a depth of -97m below the entrance.  - Descending the pitch drops into a large streamway. The main route is to head north, down the slope of calcite cemented boulders and back under the pitch. A large pool can be traversed around on the right hand side and just past the pool a small inlet in the right hand wall has been pushed for about 75m, but has not been surveyed. This fine stream passage descends at 12� to 20�, trending westwards with a mainly smooth, clean washed limestone floor which is occasionally broken with short cascades and boulders. This passage gets larger and after 135m a canyon inlet on the left is the bottom of the Vadose Oxbow. The passage continues to descend and after a further 200m the stream flows over a couple of small plunge pools and then drops down a very large pitch, named Fitch Pitch in memory of Shepton Mallet Caving Club member Terence Fitch. The top of this pitch is at a depth of -165m. The inlet above the black flowstone on the right hand wall (approximately 100m before Fitch Pitch) has been climbed into via a 4m climb. After 80m of walking sized rift the passage, named Black Stal Passage, turns north and closes down into a flat out muddy crawl which hasn't been pushed. - Back at the bottom of the 7m pitch a large passage heads south-west along a ledge with some small gours and other formations. There is a 3m drop on the left hand side of the passage down to a streamway, but the easiest way to reach the stream is to continue along the high level, down a 2m drop (where a handline is very useful) and then descend where the ledge ends into the Vadose Oxbow. The Waterfall Inlet Series is reached by following the stream back upstream to the inlet passage. This can be followed for 100m, passing below a 7m waterfall pitch, to a boulder choke. 20m back from the boulder choke it is possible to climb up and then traverse into the passage at the top of the waterfall. This passage heads south for 50m before heading north-east along a straight rift. A 4m drop can be free-climbed to eventually reach the bottom of a pitch estmated at 6m that has not been ascended. Back at the start of the Vadose Oxbow heading downstream the passage is a high and narrow vadose canyon. There is a 2m cascade and a couple of other drops which can be free-climbed, but a 3m pitch requires a rope and SRT equipment unless you are a very competent climber. After another 2m cascade the canyon opens up as it joins the main passage, 200m upstream of Fitch Pitch. - At Fitch Pitch, the ledge on the right hand side can be rigged with a traverse line. This reaches an alcove above the pitch from where another traverse can be rigged along the wall to reach the large stal boss and inlet stream on the other side. This traverse is protected with three spits. NB: be careful of loose rocks on the wall of the traverse � these fall down Fitch Pitch. On ascending the wet flowstone slope a very fine gour filled passage was found. After about 60m the passage becomes filled with breakdown, some of which is very loose and crumbly. About 90m from the pitch there is an inlet passage from the north which is the start of the Muddy Oxbow network of passages. One large passage heading east loops around to rejoin Gour Passage near the start of the narrow canyon. Another small passage heads west from Muddy Oxbow and is not surveyed, but is thought to be near the end of Black Stal Passage. If these two passages could be linked then the traverse over Fitch Pitch would not have to be rigged to reach the impressive Gour Passage. Just past the muddy inlet it is necessary to scramble down the breakdown boulders to reach the stream again. The passage narrows into a high canyon which is keyhole shaped with a wider section at the top. A couple of 2m cascades can be climbed and after 100m there is an awkward 3m cascade. Above this climb Gour Passage continues up a series of climbs of between 2m and 5m. Gour Passage ends at a chamber, with some small inlet passages, which is directly below the large entrance passage. - The approach to the pitch head of Fitch Pitch is protected with a long traverse, using 4 spits to a Y hang rigged from a stalagmite column and a spit. NB: be careful of loose rocks on the wall at the pitch head. This allows a descent of 11m to a rebelay, with a deviation rigged from a spit a few metres below the pitch head. From the spit rebelay another 7m descent lands on a ledge. This upper part of the pitch is damp so to get away from the water a traverse was rigged along the ledge for 5m, utilising 5 spits. At the end of the traverse there is an 8mm spit and a 10mm through bolt for a Y hang down the free hanging, 109m deep, lower part of the pitch. NB: use a rope protector or tackle sack to protect the rope just below the Y hang. After descending 7m going round an ar�te gives access to a wall of better rock with a slight overhang. Two bolts have been installed for a Y-hang rebelay to slightly break up the big pitch. The total depth of Fitch Pitch is 127m making it the biggest descended pitch in Thailand. The bottom of the pitch is at -293m. - At the bottom of Fitch Pitch is a 30m diameter circular chamber where the water runs into a shallow streamway and then down a couple of small holes in the floor. The passage continues beyond these sink holes and after a few metres there is a large hole in the floor on the left with a very narrow rock bridge. This passage joins up with the main stream passage below the second roped climb. Continuing past the large hole the canyon-like passage gets gradually deeper with some muddy sections. A short climb up a partly detached rock flake on the right reaches a large ledge which leads to the camp and the Fossil Series. The stream passage starts to descend more steeply, down a couple of short easy climbs to the first roped climb (anchor on the right hand wall, 1m above the floor). Beyond this a knee deep pool and a couple more easy climbs lead to the second roped climb (use the 8mm anchor on the left hand wall at shoulder height as the anchor on the right hand wall is not suitable). Opposite the top of this climb is a large stal slope with water running down it, this is the end of the �rock bridge� passage. The passage now continues as an active streamway, with pools and short drops for which several short lengths of rope or slings are useful. The next drop is in two steps, the first is free-climbable, the second can be aided by a hand-line attached to a chert knob. The following climb can be aided by a hand-line tied round a natural rock arch and the next drop (P6) has an 8mm anchor at shoulder height on the right hand wall, but a second anchor should be added here for safety. After the 6m main drop it is best to continue on the rope down a couple more short drops. Beyond this the passage levels out for a while, with some sections of wading. The stream passage continues for another 200m down a couple more short climbs to an area where it necessary to traverse over deep water. The streamway continues as a vadose passage down a series of climbs of between 2m and 4m (which were rigged with ropes) to the top of a P10. This is soon followed by a P20. From here the streamway continued as a straight vadose passage heading south-west down a series of climbs (C3, C4, C6, C5 and C6), many of which were rigged with ropes, to a sump at -447m below the entrance. This sump can be bypassed by a passage on the right to a continuation of the rift passage. After a few more short climbs (C2, C3, C2 and C3) the cave eventually sumps at a depth of -466m below the entrance. - From the bottom of Fitch Pitch, to the right of the streamway (facing downstream), by staying close to the wall of the main chamber a ledge system can be followed which leads to the sandy floored camp and the start of the Fossil Series. Just before the camp a sandy slope on the right leads to a short oxbow passage which may have another passage leading off from it. The fossil passage is a large, well decorated, level passage, starting with a sandy floor, which is crispy in places. The passage is high, but has deep undercuts where the passage meanders. Approximately 70m from the camp an area of boulder breakdown is reached. Staying close to the right hand wall leads to a small stooping height tube-like passage which has been explored, but not surveyed, down a couple of short climbs to a Y junction, left leads to a static sump with calcite floating on the surface while right leads down to a low crawl which was not pushed. Back at the entrance to this passage a sandy crawl on the left under the boulders leads to the continuation of the main fossil passage (it is also possible to scramble over the boulders). Ahead is another area of boulder breakdown that can be bypassed on the right via a well decorated stooping height undercut. A large boulder in the passage can be passed on the right at an area with a fine cracked mud floor. Just beyond this is the first inlet on the left hand side which has been surveyed for 250m in a northwards direction to where it became too low. This passage appears to be heading back to the chamber at the foot of Fitch Pitch. This passage is not obvious on the way in (it is easier to spot on the way out), so is marked by an arrow in the mud floor.  - The main passage continues to meander with deep undercuts. Just beyond a small pool, about 350m from the camp, a short climb down on the right hand side (hand-line useful) leads to a narrow, but high, rift passage. This passage goes for 30m to a static, perched sump -311m below the entrance. The main fossil passage continues for another 300m, narrowing slightly and becoming increasingly muddy at another area of boulder breakdown. Huge boulders almost completely block the passage, but a small window on the right hand side leads through to a small chamber amongst the boulders. Just beyond this window is a boulder marked with survey station '40'. On the left at this point are the Bypass Pitches. Continuing ahead you emerge from amongst the boulders into a large passage facing a steep wall with very prominent bedding planes. Going left here leads to a hole in the floor which was looked at briefly, but is surrounded by loose boulders and is likely to connect to the Bypass Pitch series. To the right the large passage continues with more scrambling over large muddy boulders. Staying near the right hand wall a shallow hole in the floor on the left was being used by several bats as a roost. Beyond this a larger hole in the floor was looked at, rocks thrown down took approximately 4 seconds to hit the floor, but the top was all covered in flowstone so is not ideal for bolting. Beyond this a muddy ledge overlooks a very large drop (again, rocks fall for 4 seconds). A rift in the floor on the left probably runs back to the flowstone hole, but this area is covered by large boulders and mud so it is difficult to get a clear idea where the solid floor is. A muddy slope leading up to the right was not explored. On the far side of the large chamber a huge stal boss can be seen. The sound of dripping and running water can be heard, but it was not possible to see where it was coming from. The top of the pitch was examined with a view to rigging for SRT with the left hand wall being the only real option. However, as everywhere was covered with mud and with lots of large boulders near the top it was decided not to attempt this. - Back at survey station '40' is the start of the Bypass Pitches. A single anchor in a large boulder on the left protects the main Y-hang for the initial drop which leads down to a re-belay on the right hand wall just below a large stal ledge on the left. This descends to a deep pool and a further couple of drops to a large ledge with another deep pool. A Y-hang on the right hand wall allows progress to continue down a couple more stal drops with a single anchor re-belay on the right hand wall at the first ledge. The pitch ends at a well decorated chamber with a muddy floor and the passage continues round a right hand bend, down a white flowstone slope and across a couple of gour pools to a waist deep pool. After this a 2m climb on the left leads to a small round chamber. Opposite the climb is a short step down into another round chamber with a deep pool. An anchor at shoulder height on the right hand wall protects progress along a submerged ledge that leads around the right-hand wall to the opposite side of the chamber where a window looks out into a large chamber (the same chamber which was seen from the top at the end of the Fossil Series). An anchor on the right is followed by two Y-hangs on the left hand wall which allows a free-hang to the steeply sloping stal floor of the chamber at the bottom of which was a sump pool. Although a large stream enters the chamber from mid-way up the left hand wall there appears to be no way of getting to it and no passage was visible. It was not possible to explore the chamber from where the rope descended due to the steep stal slope, but it may be possible to climb up by placing bolts for protection or it might be necessary to traverse 8-10m left at the top of the pitch and then drop down. The rift passage seen in the floor at the end of the Fossil Series was not seen from the base of the pitch nor was the end of the Fossil Series itself, but a light and aural connection has been made in the terminal chamber between the top of the big pitch and the bottom of the Bypass Pitches.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"Tham Pha Phueng is sign posted where the H1291 turns off the H1080, 40km away from the cave. The cave is at the bottom of the doline between the Security Development Project headquarters (1km away) and Ban Mani Phruk (500m fom the village). Just where the road starts to climb up to the village some concrete steps lead down the slope towards the cliff that can be seen to the west.

The vadose passage descends down the 20� dip for 250m to where it gets very low, passing a couple of ascending inlets on the east side. 100m from the entrance a passage to the left reaches a boulder chamber after 50m. From the boulder chamber a large passage ascends for a short distance to a choke. In the other, downhill, direction the narrow Muddy Passage heads west along the strike for 100m to a 3m climb (handline required) where the passages turns north.

Back at the Station 30 crossroads turning right enters a low, sandy passage that soon opens another large passage with muddy gours. A handline is required to descend to the downstream passage that heads west for 75m of large, boulder floored passage to where there is a boulder choke in the floor with a near vertical slope of mud and pebbles above.

Once past this crawl the passage can be followed for a total of 300 m to end in a boulder choke. This choke has been bypassed via a tight passage to rejoin the streamway, but it in June 2018 it was sumped after a few metres. - The downstream (left) streamway often has two sections � a lower level at stream level that requires occasional crawling and a higher level over mud coated boulders.has been surveyed for about 150 m into a higher level which had a coating of slippery mud.  - A large seasonal stream enters over a big stal cascade on the left (south) side. Climbing up this gets to about 150-200 m of walking passage with a strong draught and much surface debris � ends at a short stal constriction which will need a hammer and chisel to get through to the larger continuation. - After 350 m a chamber is reached were a high rift enters from the north.

Several smaller connecting caves branch out from the main cave. - Local legend maintains that King Taksin escaped execution after the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 by substituting another victim and lived out his life piously in the cave. The abbott has kept a number of small bronze, gold and silver Buddhas found in the area. Other versions of the King Taksin story have him regrouping in Rayong and Chantaburi provinces before recapturing Ayutthaya and living until 1782.

In the passage there are the remains of a concrete path, footbridges, water tanks, a large seated Buddha and a particularly scary statue of a man. - Two main passages divide off from the room at the end of the entrance tunnel - the left hand branch and the right hand branch. The left hand branch is the larger of the two being 10m wide and 3m high. It sweeps around broad meandering bends for a distance of about 400m to end at a static sump. Various Buddhas, bizarre statues, water tanks and concrete walls have been constructed along its length and there is even a toilet. A seasonal stream flows along the left hand branch during the rainy season. The water rises out of the terminal static sump and probably originates from Cave NT0040 on the opposite side of the ridge. A minor side passage located beneath a 20m high aven drops down a 3m climb to a small sump with crystal clear blue water. - The right hand branch starts as easy walking past more statues and over the top development to a 90� turn to the left and a change in character. The passage becomes smaller, requiring crawling in places and eventually ends too tight.  A seasonal stream flows into the cave from the end and joins that of the left hand branch before flowing out to the entrance.  Near the turn to the left a set of steps leads up into a small room with a concrete sleeping platform installed. -  - Fauna includes at least 4 species of bat: 2 Hipposideros sp. (1 large, 1 small), Rhinolophus sp. and a small Vespertilionid. There are also crickets, amblypygids, huntsman spiders and small white flies. One small white Opilione was seen in the right hand branch using its front legs as feelers and was probably troglobitic. Small catfish and nemacheilines were found in the pools and water tanks.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"The cave is in moo 2 Khao Kaeo.

The entrance to the cave is via some very steep steps up the side of the resurgence boulder choke to a collapse entrance above. Even steeper ladders lead down to the stream inside the cave and the first 250 m of the streamway has been developed into a show cave with electric lighting. - Downstream the water immediately disappears into boulders. Upstream is easy walking for 250 m in a large passage lined in part with deeply dissected gravel banks to a junction (The Fork) where a large stream enters on the right. This western stream is up to 30 m high and 30 m wide in places and climbs steadily up a series of small flowstone cascades in a large, meandering passage. A section of deeper water is encountered about 700 m from the junction and swimming is required to reach the end of the large passage. Here there is a phreatic tube on the right that ascends to a pitch back down to the stream, while on the left there is a vadose rift to a small inlet waterfall which has been climbed to reach a couple of hundred metres of streamway. The main western stream continues beyond the pitch for about 500 m (Brian's Extension) to an aven. This aven, and the subsequent pitches aid climbed to a second entrance located 1.6km from and 100 m above the main entrance. - Back at The Fork the lefthand branch is the eastern stream which can be followed for 250 m to a sharp right hand bend with deep water. This passage continues, with a strong water current, for an estimated 700 m to a 6 m waterfall. In low water conditions this has been climbed and the passage above explored up several cascades to ascend about 50 m and ending at a sump. About 50 m before the sump there is a climb on the eastern wall (Andy's Climb) that leads to an extensive series of dry passages and a link back to the streamway befond the first sump.

The floor had no foot prints or other signs of previous visitation, and the air was very stale. The passage measured 65 feet wide and 70+ feet tall and was highly decorated. With a sense of wonder I walked down this magnificent passage, that keep getting larger. At one point the passage was 70 ft wide and over 100 ft tall.  The passage ended at a large formation area with some possible way on with a little free climbing. I elected to forgo the climb as by this time I realized that the air was bad. My lips and fingertips were tingling, and I was getting short of breath. So I headed back to the entrance. I decided that I would document the cave and take a few pics on the way out. I wasn't too worried about the air as my movements had been shadowed by an unidentified small mammal (not a rat). I figured that if he could survive there, I could as well if I took things easy. The trip back was uneventful but slow as I took my measurements. The cave length was measured at 1242 feet and the depth at 135 ft. I will probably return at some point hoping for better air.

Just past the wat at Tham Sombat the cave is signposted along a path that heads north and contours around the western flank of the hill for about 600 m to a cave entrance."
3457,karstlink:UndergroundCavity ,Martin Ellis,CC-BY-SA,20/04/2019,20/04/2019,https://www.thailandcaves.shepton.org.uk,Tham Yai Nam Nao,PE0005,,16.945236513497687,101.50689881900475,716,,10597,109,,,TH,,Martin Ellis,EN,,"The path to the cave leads past the resurgence cave and a small shrine cave, up some metal steps to the main entrance. Inside the cave a metal ladder and walkway soon leads to the 'Second' entrance. By exiting the cave via this entrance it is possible to ascend the cliff to the 'Monk' entrance which links to the main cave via a 14 m pitch and through a squeeze to the 'Bat' entrance passage. The 'Bat' entance passage, which is large and has a skylight entrance, descends steeply back to the main 'Tourist Cave' There is a bat colony in the big chamber where the 'Bat' entrance enters. Beyond the bat chamber the cave has a few formations and then reaches a breakdown area with a series of high level passages ascending up on the right. Above a 4 m climb, which has not been ascended, there is a large bat chamber and a very high skylight entrance. Although this high entrance has been found on the surface at 47Q 767119 1875010 and an altitude of 884 m, the underground link has not been completed.  - After the breakdown area there is a mud floored chamber that funnels down to the left. By descending this it is possible to go through a low, squalid, occasionally wet section to reach the bottom of the 6m ladder. However, it is easier to follow the lit tourist trail which ends at the top of the solidly constructed 6 m metal ladder. Descending the ladder leads to a series of smaller, muddy passages. The main way on, marked with white paint arrows, is a short crawl on the right followed by some smaller passages with a second crawl. Finally there is a flat out crawl of about 10 m over mud which breaks out into a large passage with a mud and silt floor. - This large passage ends by descending a mud slope to a stooping and crawling height passage. This area occasionally has a pool of water and can be prone to carbon dioxide build up. This 'CO2 Sump' can also sump with percolation water at the end of the wet season. However, once past this low section you regain the large passage, named 'Main Passage' by the 1992 expedition, which meanders gently to the junction with the streamway. The passage is floored with sand and dry mud which has created some large mudbanks. The 'CO2 Sump' can be bypassed by traversing around the far wall of the chamber before the slope down into the sump, heading for a passage that leads over the top. An awkward 2 m climb up then a 8 m pitch and mud slope down regains the main passage. This bypass has been left bolted by the SMCC. - At the streamway it is possible to climb down the 3 m bank of cobbles and mud fill. It is also possible to reach the stream via the network of small passages on the left just before the climb. Downstream enters a small passage with many cascades and deep pools, a couple of which can require swimming to cross in high water conditions, to end at a sump. Upstream is a magnificently large streamway with a lot of cemented cobble fill on the walls and floor. After 275 m the passage makes a 90� turn to the south. The passage changes character as the gradient is lower and more wading is required, often at stooping height. It is possible to bypass one particularly low and wet section by taking a high level route on the left hand side. - Before reaching this high level bypass there is a small, insignificant inlet on the left hand (eastern) wall of the passage. This starts as a flat out crawl over cobbles to a small chamber. More crawling leads to a stream which disappears into a very small hole in the left hand wall. The stream way continues as mostly crawling for a total of 300 m to a wide pool with very limited airspace. A gravel bank was dug out to lower the water level and crawling through the duck for 50 m leads into a high rift passage which is the end of Tham Pha Rai.  - Tham Pha Rai is an active swallet and was known as Wet Sink to the 1992 expedition. The entrance is located in the first doline to the south-east of the small farm at the end of the track to the 1.2km east of the ranger station parking place. After descending into the doline the path flattens out as it goes through an old banana plantation and around 100 m further on the stream channel is 30 m to your right. There are two entrances, but there is little point scrambling up to the dry entrance as you will soon get wet inside the cave. Going in the wet entrance and across a 0.5 m deep pool brings you to a 7 m pitch. At the bottom of this the stream descends a couple of short drops and after crossing a pool a crawl leads to the main streamway. Upstream the passage can be followed for 100 m through a couple of ducks to a sump. Downstream the cave goes for about 500 m through varied passage. In places the passage is large and triangular in cross-section where it has formed along the strike. In other places it is necessary to crawl under flowstone blockages. Eventually the stream disappears into a low passage and then sumps. Just before the stream enters the low section there is a small hole on the right which leads up into a boulder choke above the sump. A route through the boulder choke was found (it has been marked with string!) which leads back to the stream. This stream passage is generally small and it is often necessary to crawl round low sections, over boulders, wade a short canal, etc. to eventually reach the high inclined rift passage which has already been described from the Tham Yai Nam Nao end. The through trip from Tham Pha Rai to Tham Yai Nam Nao is recommended. -  - After the Tham Pha Rai inlet and high level passage you reach the 'Y Junction'. The main stream comes in from under the left (eastern) wall and can be difficult to spot � it wasn't found by the 1992 expedition and the 2003 expedition walked past it twice before finding the duck under into the streamway. This junction is clearly marked with a painted 'Y'. This streamway, named the '2004 Series', was first explored by the Shepton Mallet Caving Club in January 2004. At the 'Y Junction' a short, wet crawl leads into larger passage where there is a short section of wading in deep water. The stream meanders across the floor of a fairly straight passage and there are extensive deposits of sand and mud. After 450 m the roof lowers and more wading is required. The water gets steadily deeper until at 700 m from the junction you are in water over 1.5 m deep with only 20 cm of airspace. The water soon gets shallower, but the low, wet crawling continues for another 200 m until you reach larger passage and can stand up out of the water. This series of wet crawls ends in a very high rift passage. The passage is now easy going for about 400 m to a dry oxbow on the left which is followed for 100 m back to the streamway. After the oxbow the streamway continues for a further 1,500 m to the upstream sump and no side passages or inlets have been found (only two groups have been to the sump). The going is mainly wading with varying water depths and one short swim. In one section, just before the sump, the passage is up to 20 m wide and 45 m high and there are a couple of places where it is necessary to scramble over boulders with the stream flowing below. Large numbers of medium sized bats have been seen in a couple of places in the 2004 Series suggesting that there are other entrances into this section of the cave. The 2004 Series heads in a south-easterly direction and is a fairly straight passage with few meanders. This trend follows the alignment of ridge of the mountain above the cave and is following the strike of the limestone's bedding. The upstream sump is 300 m from the stream in Cave 25 and the downstream sump in Tham Bah Dahn.  - From the 'Y Junction' the other branch of the cave leads southwards and has been named the '1992 Series' as it was first explored by the 1992 UK student expedition. In the dry season it does not have a stream for most of its length until you reach the 'Boulder Chamber'. After about 200 m it is necessary to crawl through a low, muddy, sometimes wet, passage for about 100 m. Above this section there is a series of dry, boulder-filled chambers. Cave 14, which has a 20 m entrance shaft and then 80 m of low, muddy, crawls, joins the main cave just before this crawling section. After the crawl the large passage is regained and it is mainly easy going for 500 m to the 'Boulder Chamber' with just some crawls under boulders and flowstone to negotiate. About 100 m before reaching the Boulder Chamber there is a small series of side passages that has been used as a campsite by previous explorers, probably monks. - The 'Boulder Chamber' is a collapse feature on the left (eastern) side of the stream passage. It is possible, with great care, to ascend the slope of boulders and debris to reach the back wall of the chamber, but the rock is heavily corroded and friable. Although there didn't appear to be a passage entering into the roof of the chamber there might be a high level passage heading back upstream, but access would be via a very exposed traverse. - After the 'Boulder Chamber' the stream passage becomes smaller and passes through a couple of small, decorated chambers. Eventually the passage degenerates to a series of four ducks which are easily passed and the cave opens up again. After the ducks the 200 m of large passage is quickly traversed to end at a large gour that fills the passage. - About 50 m before the gour there is a tall, vadose inlet passage on the right (western) side, named the '1992 Series Inlet'. This inlet passage can be followed for about 400 m to a boulder choke. The stream is regained beyond the choke and can be followed upstream to a 5 m climb up a waterfall. This is a difficult free climb and a handline is advised. The water is then followed to a second boulder choke. The path of least resistance through the choke leads to a duck which may need bailing. After the duck a crawl of 10 m goes straight on and then sharp left to a squeeze beyond which a very tight slot up to the left leads to the surface. Above the first boulder choke there is a chamber where evidence of a camp and bats was found. - The 1992 expedition had failed to pass the large gour that blocks the main stream passage in the 1992 Series. In January 2005 concerted canal digging lowered the water level by 20 cm. A wet crawl leads to the left while the stream comes in from the right. Continuing to the left through a flat out crawl in a pool leads to a small chamber. The way on is to crawl through another pool and head right to a dry crawl. Finally, bearing left and following the crawl over cobbles, allows the very large passage to be regained. By ascending the boulder floored passage a pool is reached at the base of a 10 m aven. The stream enters at the top of this aven which has not been climbed and is currently the end of exploration in this section of the cave.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"This is the longest cave that has been found in the Nam Nao National Park and is now the third longest known cave in Thailand.  It is a popular tourist attraction and is clearly signposted from the H2216 in Ban Non Chat.  At busy holiday times there are stalls selling food, but at other times there are just one or two rangers who are there to guide tourists into the cave."

The main passage of Tham Wi Mahn Mek has several skylights and goes through the hill to a second entrance. A passage to the right inside the main entrance leads to a large chamber in the floor of which there is a very large pitch that has been aurally connected with the pitch in Tham Nop Pa Krauw, but the pitch has not been descended. The total depth of this pitch is around 70m. - The entrance to Tham Nop Pa Krauw is located lower down the hill than Tham Wi Mahn Mek. On the first visit was in January 2004 exploration was soon stopped by a crawl after 90m. This crawl was dug out a year later to reach about 40m of passage ending at a pitch which was descended into a big chamber where the connection to Tham Wi Mahn Mek was above and to the right. In January 2006 the pitches linking this cave to Tham Phaya Naak were descended and surveyed. - The southern entrance to the lowest cave in the system, Tham Phaya Naak, is small, but a very strong draught blows out of the cave. A 3m bamboo ladder lands in a narrow passage that gradually gets larger as heads north-east until another 3m bamboo ladder allows access to the large main passage. A high level oxbow goes from above this second ladder goes around into the main passage. In the main passage there is a shrine in front of a large calcite column and the cave is also used by the monks for walking meditation. The large passage descends gently to a junction with a passage on the right.  - The right hand passage soon reaches a T junction and the pitch in from Tham Nop Pa Krauw lands at the junction. To the left leads steeply up a mud slope to end at the foot of an aven. This pitch is stal covered and appears to be about 20m high. To the right the passage soon ends at a grotto where a pit in the floor has been descended for 4m and was found to be blind. This blind pit is above the high rift passage in Tham Bah Dahn, which is a stream cave about 30m below. Before the grotto an inclined, mud floored passage on the right can be followed for about 30m.  - Back at the junction the main passage continues, but soon reduces in size.

The stream flows along a lower side passage, rejoining the upper level after 150 m before it promptly disappears into boulders. A route through these may be possible, though climbing up and over is easier. Following initial muddy boulders is a vast slope of dry dust and rocks that becomes steeper and increasingly unstable with further progress. At the base of the slope is a narrow canyon from which the sound of cascading water can be heard.  - Tham Phet: The cave is a large resurgence and the entrance has been dammed resulting in the the first 150 to 200 m being clogged with mud. Heading upstream this changes to gravel and rock. Except for a dry higher bypass 550 m from the entrance the whole cave is active stream passage and the orignial exploration ended at a third waterfall which appeares to be a fairly easy climb.

After a boulder room with a skylight entrance, a small seasonal inlet comes in from the left.

More short rapids follow in a vadose canyon with a large upper level visible overhead.  The cave was explored to where the stream passage becomes a crawl through boulders and the upper level ends similarly.  A strong draught issues from the boulders suggesting that continuation is possible. - Tham Thaphat was explored from the sink entrance though not surveyed.  Walking size stream passage passes several side and skylight entrances to reach a breakdown room and large entrance.  The stream disappears into the boulders and is not met again until very close to Tham Phanthip.

Turning left (downstream) is a large passage that ends after about 80 m in boulders with daylight visible. A small inlet near the end leads to a porcupine den. Upstream the passage is large and impressive. A small permanent stream is soon met and is followed around large meander bends to a boulder chamber. Climbing up and over the boulders, one can drop back down to the stream passage on the orther side, though beyond here the cave is much smaller. A short crawl along the gravel floored stream bed opens up at a small breakdown chamber. At a large bend, an inlet which has not been explored enters from a low passage on the right. The main stream passage continues to the south-west at stooping height. Gradually the roof lowers and another crawl is met with low airspace. Following this is another breakdown chamber and another flat-out crawl that was not pushed.

There are two entrances. The main, dry entrance is very obvious on the left when entering the temple area and is developed with a partial concrete floor, Buddha images, etc. In January 2012 this was being upgraded with additional ceramic floor tiles. A large passage leads around massive speleothems to reach the stream after 60 m. The stream sink entrance is located behind the temple and is smaller in size with some crawling required. Downstream from where the main entrance and stream sink meet, the cave is mostly easy walking in a meandering passage for 700 m. The water is shallow and extensive gravel banks line the cave. A couple of short crawls and a stooping section add interest. Parts of the main stream passage are well decorated with good displays of helictites and anthodites. Visitors have broken many stalactites though some are regrowing.  - At 700 m from the main entrance, the stream starts falling down rapids and a boulder chamber opens up. The stream disappears into the breakdown and cannot be followed far.  Scrambling over the muddy boulder pile regains the stream on the other side after 80 m.  Here the cave continues as a rift, 10 m high, inclined at about 70�.  Varied walking, short crawls and climbing over boulders reaches the end of the cave after 200 m at a static sump having left the stream where it flows into a too tight passage. The obvious upper level is mud choked. A strong draught blows throughout the cave indicating that another entrance could exist.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"From the H4 junction with the H415, travel 5.8km in the direction heading from Thap Put to Phang Nga town on H4. This will take you through the village of Ban Tham Thong Lang (old sign in English, but hard to read) to a right hand junction signed to Ban Niwang (sign in English). Turn right here and after 100m turn right at the next junction following this road, passing a quarry on your right with the crushing area on the left. Ignore the minor road on your right and after 1.4km you will reach another junction with a concrete road on your right. Follow this road for 1.3km, which starts off relatively flat between the karst hills, passing through some villages and a basic football field on your right before reaching a junction where you should go straight ahead (and not take the turning on the right).  Continue to follow this road (which starts off as concrete, but becomes a rough track) for a further 1.8km which climbs uphill then down between palm oil tree plantations, crossing a couple of bridges over a small streams. You then reach a small track on your left, ahead is a small bridge to houses. Turn left here and after 200m you will arrive at a parking area for the temple."

Only one group of cavers has been to the end (monks had been there before them) on a two day camping trip in April 1998. - The entrance section of Tham Phra Wang Daeng is a huge collapse chamber with two entrances facing each other. A foot path crosses through the upper levels, passing a golden Buddha and a flat, painted rock symbolising a turtle. Two monk platforms are erected in the middle of the entrance chamber. On the opposite side, the path continues to the downstream entrance of the cave.  - Descending the steep boulder pile in the entrance chamber, a small hole in the floor has a cellar door gives access to the upstream section of the cave. Inside, the steep descent over huge boulders continues, finally going down a concrete stairway to the bottom of the first boulder choke where the stream is reached. Downstream the water quickly disappears into a boulder choke, but it can be rejoined after a few hundred meters from the downstream entrance. The section of Tham Phra Wang Daeng downstream from the entrance, though nowhere near as long as the upstream section, is characterized by a sequence of small cascades.  - Heading upstream some gours damming the stream soon lead to the first swim. Here a steep climb to the left (as seen in the downstream direction) leads up to a large Buddha statue, while an even steeper climb to the right over muddy flowstone, rigged by the local monks with a thick knotted rope, leads up for 30 m to an upper dry gallery. Again, the passage is dominated by a golden Buddha statue. At the far end of the bypass a slippery boulder pile leading down to the stream has to be negotiated, this time without the help of a handline. Thus, the bypass can be used to avoid the first swim. Back down at stream level, a large pool is found, which hosts an abundance of white cave fish.  - Progressing upstream from the first pool the passage obviously leaves the entrance area, which is dominated by its huge boulder choked sections, giving way to several hours of walking, swimming and bouldering along the main streamway. The size of the streamway starts at 10 m wide and 5 m high, but increases to a width of 25-30 m and a height of 20-25 m. Only a few minor inlets are passed, all of them dry at the end of the dry season. After a little over 2 km, a second huge collapse area is reached. The entire river passage is blocked by a huge boulder choke which gives access to a large, dry boulder chamber at roof level. Here a major fault zone is intersected by the cave, as a result of which the ceiling has collapsed to the overlying sandstone, burying the stream passage for approximately 100 m. A tiny red string marks the best way through this unstable zone was placed by the monks.  - After passing the second boulder choke the active passage continues in a southerly direction. At a false junction a dead end passage leads straight ahead while the streamway makes an obvious easterly turn. The dimensions of the gallery become smaller again with an average passage size of 10 m by 15 m. The phreatic origin of the passage is more obvious here with an elliptic tube in the upper part of the section and a meandering vadose streamway cutting into the lower parts. In two places the streamway is almost entirely blocked by flowstone and at a small cascade a basaltic dyke intersects the passage. Roughly 3 km from the second boulder choke the passage enters a huge fault, leaving the ceiling some tens of meters higher. A sizeable, but seasonal inlet enters from the left � The Sandy Inlet. The cave continues as a tall, meandering vadose canyon and progress is easy walking on gravel banks. A sharp bend to the right is reached where large boulders need scrambling over. An unexplored upper level goes off from here and a 20 m tall column stands on a ledge high above the floor. - Beyond the boulders the main stream tunnel continues around several bends. Fins of basalt dykes cross the cave in several places and small rapids flow over flowstone. About 350 m beyond the boulders a deeper pool of water requires wading at a sharp right and bend. A little further on another upper level enters from the right. More easy walking over gravel banks and through shallow water leads to a point where large boulders almost block the cave. It is possible to climb up through the boulders for 15 m and enter a large chamber above. Care is needed on the climb as some boulders are loose. Unexplored upper levels lead off in two directions. Scrambling down a brown flowstone cascade on the opposite side of the chamber reaches the stream again.  Immediately upstream of the boulder room a small inlet enters the cave via a 10 m high aven. - About 50 m further is a low flowstone roof and this is the only place where hands and knees crawling is required in the main stream passage. There is a very powerful draught through this low section.  After the low section easy walking in a round tunnel passes an unexplored inlet on the right and two upper levels on the left. The passage rises in height to become a canyon again and widens out at a round chamber where a vadose canyon carries the stream through the middle of the room. - At the far end of this chamber a short scramble over boulders leads back to the stream and the passage continues. The passage is small in places and crosses many basalt dykes. A sharp left hand bend is reached after about 200 m, the exploration and survey trip that reached the end of the cave camped in some large sand filled gours located on this bend. Shallow wading continues to a boulder pile which is easily passed on the right to regain the larger stream tunnel. Basalt dykes start to increase in number again and at a sharp right hand bend a boulder room is reached where the right hand wall is formed by the dyke. Climbing over the boulders and down the other side is the way through to a short section of streamway and more boulders. Beyond here, about 350 m past the camp, the stream tunnel assumes large proportions again and continues very spectacularly for about 1 km. - The canyon soon reaches a place called the 'Big Bend'. Here the 10 m wide and 20 m high passage turns nearly 180� to the right and an excellent view is seen down both tunnels from the outside edge. Continuing past here the tunnel turns a few meanders, passes an aven inlet on the left, an upper level on the right and a large walking sized inlet which is also on the right. A huge vadose canyon, 20 m high and 10 m wide, disappears on into the dark ahead. This passage heads south and is almost straight for about 350 m, following a basalt dyke in the roof. Easy walking on gravel banks allows the explorer to get a good look at this superb section of cave. - At the end of the canyon a prominent basalt dyke crosses the cave and the passage bends to the left. Passing a large tilted boulder of flowstone the cave becomes smaller and one wall consists of cemented gravel and cobbles. After a low flowstone roof an upper level enters and a basalt dyke crosses the passage. A large boulder room now opens up ahead, the third major boulder room in the cave and one of the largest. A large number of complicated routes may be taken over, under and through the boulders, but basically it is easiest to try to keep to the stream and go under.  Great care is needed in places as some very large boulders appear to be precariously wedged. - Following the boulder chamber the cave has much less impressive proportions. A low and wide passage with a gravel floor continues. In one place it is necessary to crawl for the second time in the cave. Additionally there is no detectable draught after the last boulder chamber. Some 200 m beyond the boulder chamber a sharp limestone shelf projects out into the passage at a left hand bend. A low cawling sized inlet or oxbow enters here and a rift crosses the cave on a fault. A small room opens up with large boulders and an upper level in the roof. The stream continues in a wide and low fashion. A too tight inlet on the right and a short scramble over some nice gours leads into more low and wide passage. This gradually enlarges to a left hand bend where a small inlet enters on the right. The stream turns sharply to the left, the water deepens and the upstream sump is reached 9,637 m from the entrance and 39 m above it.",Martin Ellis,EN,,From Ban Chomphu drive through the check point into the national park.

At the bottom a dry sandy gallery heads in a northerly direction. After 100 m the seasonally active stream passage is entered where two overflow gullies head towards the resurgence. The passage continues partially filled with stagnant water with an average width and height of 5-10 m. After 300 m a large chamber is reached which is filled with a huge sand dune. Only a windy passage at the bottom of the dune gives access to the way on. This section with its distinct watermarks along the walls clearly shows the nearly stagnant flow in the cave after the wet season. The passage continues along the strike of the bedding. In some sections the stream has cut through layers of large cobbles up to 2 m thick. Beyond the windy passage the next landmark is a flowstone bridge. Climbing above the bridge is a high level inlet which is about 250 m long. A couple of hundred metres after the flowstone bridge there is a junction with a passage to the right sumps after 100 m.  - The main passage continues 2 to 5 m wide and 1 to 3 m high to where the 1997 survey stopped. The way on is the crawl on the right and 100 m past this crawl an inlet at stream level has been explored for 380 m.Another high level inlet on the left 200 m upstream of the first crawl was explored for 280 m. The cave continues for about 400 m in passages approximately 1 m high and active in the wet season. Finally a tight squeeze over a flowstone barrier blocking the entire passage is reached. After negotiating this selective obstacle the final section of Tham Phra Sai Ngam is found, with dimensions increasing to 2 m by 2 m again. The passage ends in a series of high avens interconnected by a tiny water filled meander.

At the entrance is a low airspace duck with deep water. This can be passed to a stream passage. At a point 20 m from the entrance, a tight passage has been climbed to a higher entrance 15 m above the lower one. In the main passage after 20 m it is necessary to duck through on the right past a couple of rifts into the continuation of the stream passage. The passage gets larger and the walls are coated with flowstone. 90 m from the entrance the passage splits at a pool held back by a flowstone barrier. Straight on, up another flowstone cascade, ends at a pool where the water is thought to well up from the bottom. To the right at the junction is a sloping rift that has been followed for about 10 m. This cave is the resurgence for the Tham Khang Khao stream and although the link has not been confirmed by cavers, blue water supply hoses from Tham Nam Tok have been seen down the pitch that takes the Tham Khang Khao stream. - Tham Khang Khao is the obvious entrance that can be seen part way up the cliff with a footpath leading up to it across the field. The upper entrance is 5 m square and gives access into the roof of a large stream cave, but to reach the stream a 20 m pitch would have to be descended.  Instead, 10 m below Tham Khang Khao and a little to the south is a second smaller entrance at the base of a small cliff which gives access to the stream level of the cave via an easy scramble down boulders. Below the entrance climb the downstream passage has been pushed through boulders to come out 50 m to the south, at a point which must be close to the end of Tham Dak Ga Deen Yak. - The main stream passage is 1.5 km long and goes upstream. The passage is 15-20 m high by 5 m wide and floored with gravel, bedrock and occasional pools.  About 150 m from the entrance a large proportion of the stream disappears down a hole with a 4 m pitch on the north-west side of the passage. This pitch lands in deep water and looks like it might sump, but blue water supply pipes which have been installed from Tham Nam Tok can be seen, confirming the link.  - The main stream passage ends at a large chamber where two tributary streams join. In the chamber, between the two inlet stream passages, a steep 10 m climb up flowstone led into an inlet passage that was explored for an estimated 100 m and had footprints coming into the cave! Other possible passages or alcoves are visible in the roof of the chamber. The left hand tributary can be followed for another kilometre to an upstream sump. This passage is mainly less than 2 m wide and is 2 to 5 m high. After 600 m the passage becomes a flat out crawl, which has a high level bypass. Upstream of this obstacle there is a large chamber before the sump. The right hand tributary has just under a kilometre of passage to another upstream sump.

Turn left and follow the road east past a monastery (with a cave) at the foot of an isolated hill. The road trends south and ends at the Wat Tham Phra Phothisat monastery. This cave has four entrances and is the longest known cave in the province.  Tham Mathat is reached by a good concrete path and steps leading up the hill from the monastery.  It has an unlocked gate and a steel ladder down into the cave.  The main entrance to Tham Lumphini Suan Hin is not signed and the path up to the entrance is slightly overgrown.  This is because some foreigners had to be rescued from the cave a few years ago and access is not encouraged.  From the temple follow the main path to Tham Phra Phothisat and Tham Mathat. At a tree with a signpost turn right and cross the stream. Look for a gully after the stream and a path which leads steeply up to the main entrance.  The sink entrances are at the other side of the hill and are best reached through the cave."

It is much visited for the spectacle of between 800,000 and 1,800,000 wrinkled-lipped bats flying out at dusk in a spectacular swirling cloud, constantly moving across the sky for about 40 minutes. -  - Two entrances are visible when approaching along the track, although only the left hand entrance is accessible. At the end of the track a path leads steeply uphill to the foot of the cliffs and the entrance. A difficult climb prevents the right hand hole from being reached from the outside. - The tunnel leading into the cave is large, about 10 m high and wide. The pathway passes underneath a low 'roof' of false floor. The floor rises gently and fresh guano begins to accumulate in larger quantities until after about 90 m a huge chamber opens up. Daylight enters from two skylights at the highest point in the roof. By turning right at the archway into the chamber and climbing up and over the boulder pile the second entrance is revealed at the end of a short passage. - Continuing forwards enters the main chamber proper with is approximately 100 m long, 25 m wide and up to 40 m high. The sloping floor consists of boulders covered with dry, dusty guano. Only by climbing to the top of this steep, bouldery slope can the rest of the cave by explored. At the top, on a large flat boulder, is a Buddha statue. Most of teh bats roosting in the cave do so in the darker areas of this chamber and the following rift pasaage. It was near this spot that the inscribed tablet dating back to the Sukhothai Period was found that makes the cave historically famous. - A tall, narrow, rift type passage leads on into the continuation of the cave. Descending the boulder and guano slope into the rift reveals a low arch on the left. This is the way into a bypass passage which avoids a difficult climb stopping progress along the main rift. After travelling some 80 m the bypass begins to rise up a pile of guano into the next section of large rift. This chamber has two ways leaading off. Straight ahead enters another high roofed room the floor of which slopes away down to a complete blockage of guano and rocks. The second, main way on is a low arch on the right. This descends past guano, dead bats and rat skeletons to another high roofed chamber formed on a minor fault parallel to the main fracture. - By climbing up over slippery boulders to the far side of the room a 4 m square passage opens up which can be followed to a left hand bend. Here the cave has followed a cross joint to step back to the main fault again. An old wooden ladder makes a short climb in the cross-over passage easier and leads to a hole in the floor which goes nowhere. Climbing up to the right here finds another ladder covering a smaller hole. Upon reaching the main fault again the cave becomes a lot smaller, just 5 m high and 3 m wide on a flowstone floor. - Shortly a 2 m climb down is reached witha  wooden ladder in place and the top of a large hole in the floor. This is the head of a 30 m pitch into the lower levels of the cave. A wooden pathway has been constructed around the side of the hole and leads to a continuation passage on the opposite side. First rising and then descending this passage leads to another deep hole which draughts strongly. It is presumed to connect to the lower levels, though this is not confirmed. Beyond this point a short, dirty climb takes the explorer to the final 80 m of passage. A large bat colony roosts in a high aven part way along here.The cave ends at a complete flowstone blockage. The floor in the final section consists of flowstone and old dry guano deposits. It sounds hollow as it is a false floor and the 20 m high rift of the lower level is directly underneath. - The 30 m pitch is positioned on the main faultine and is descended in two sections. The first part is rigged from a large, redissolved stalagmite with deviations via a bolt and a thread to help avoid the worst abrasion points. A large ledge breaks the pitch about half way down and a large natural thread is used to belay the last, freehanging, 15 m section. This drops into a large rift chamber representing the continuation of the main rift at a lower level. - Uphill climbs up boulders to a long guano and soil slope. The top of this lies very close to the foot of the slope at the end of the main rift. A connection is suspected. Leaving the rift chamber at the opposite, downhill end is a narrow rift passage. After 15 m this straight passage leads to a junction. Left quickly divides again at another junction which becomes too small to the left and too dangerous over large boulders to the right. This simply connects back to the main passage anyway. Back at the first junction the main passage to the right opens up again to an impressive rift 5 m wide and 20 m high. The floor slopes away over boulders and guano to the lip of a 10 m drop which is avoided by taking a small bypass passage hidden in the left wall behind a flake. From here the main rift climbs up a sloping guano floor. At the top of the slope the rift appears to end suddenly at a sharp right hand bend. Around the corner though is a pitch which descends for 10 m to a false floor and then continues for another 11 m to the bottom. This leads to an third level of rift passages which contain a seasonal stream, but no obvious ways on.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"This cave is located in Tham Phra Ram Non-Hunting Area, about 50 km north-west of Sukhothai town. Turn off the main road about halfway between Sukhothai and Tak and take the H1327 Ban Huai Khrai. In Ban Huai Khrai turn west to the Thung Saliam ranger station. - The area outside the cave has been developed for tourists wishing to see the bats fly out in the evening. There is the usual 200 baht fee for foreigners, Thais get in free and there is a 20 baht charge for motorbikes."

The state of preservation is poor and a great age is therefore inferred. It has been suggested that the posts once supported a Buddha image, but they may once have been used to support coffins. - Leading off from the entrance chamber are several passages. Most either loop around or end quickly, becoming too tight or blocked with sediments. At the bottom right hand corner is an obvious walking sized passage. This bends first right and the  left and finishes after about 20 m at a 5 m climb up to a small hole.

Without a beach allowing easy landing and without drinking water, it is inhabited only by workers coming to harvest the swallows� nests. Given the value of these nests, it is highly protected and inaccessible to tourists. The archaeologists could only make a brief prospection of the site. The soil of these caves, neither deep nor wide, but with a steep slope, is covered with guano. The prospecting allowed them to collect a shard of decorated polychrome pottery that echoed the corpus that the island would already have delivered almost a century ago, and that W. Solheim published in 1966. It seems that nothing favors settlement on these islands. Their only advantage is the very good view of boats approaching Ko Samui. This island with reliefs steep, easy to spot at sea, could serve as a stopover to bivouac during trips or fishing expeditions. Its caves have probably been used by maritime populations for the conduct of their funerary rites, like the majority of caves that have delivered pottery.",Martin Ellis,EN,,This small island is 4 km off the south-west coast of Ko Samui.

The lowest level is the active streamway which can be followed for nearly the entire distance from the sink to the resurgence. About 25m above this level is the majority of the cave passage. Some of these passages, such as Tourist Cave and Southern High Level, take water in the wet season, either by backing up of the stream or from seasonal streams flowing through them. Other passages such as Shrine Passage and South-East Passage do not appear to take any water. The highest level, 25m above the middle level, consists of Bamboo Ladder Cave and Bedding Cave. - From the main entrance, known as Tourist Entrance to the SMCC, a very pleasant mud floored passage, 5-10m wide by 10-40m high, and called the Tourist Cave, meanders gently in a southward direction for around 750m. One small side passage reaches a narrow rift which can be climbed up to enter a chamber with an entrance, Spider Entrance, which comes out near the Umphang town rubbish dump. The main passage ends at a chamber where a bamboo ladder aids the ascent up out of a rift to the upper part of the chamber. Below this ladder is a small hole that goes into the low and muddy passage to the East Passage. At the far end of the chamber a slope down reaches a rift passage where there are a couple of bamboo bridges over holes. This passage is rockier and more awkward than the entrance series, but eventually, after a scramble over some flowstone, the passage drops down into a flat floored chamber about 950m from the Tourist Entrance. - Ahead is a steep boulder slope that ascends about 25m to the Backdoor entrance. A few metres up the slope, on the right hand side, there is a small hole that opens into Shrine Passage. Back in the flat floored chamber a large passage opens on the left at the bottom of the boulder slope. This passage, Southern High Level, as its name suggests heads southwards for about 500m with an easy going, 10m wide by 10-20m high mud floored route. There are a couple of breakdown chambers where a decorated high level oxbow, Umphang Gallery, joins the Southern High Level. Southern High Level ends at the largest chamber in the cave where another boulder slope leads up to the Side Entrance. To the south of this entrance the passage descend the boulders to rejoin the Southern High Level where once again it is easy going in large passage for 200m until the passage closes down. A narrower, but still comfortable, route over flowstone and a couple of short climbs ends at a 6m pitch down into the streamway. By traversing over the stream the Pothole Entrance can be reached. - The cave in the Monk's and Main Entrance area is very complex. From Main Entrance the South East Entrance can be reached and after a traverse over the streamway this heads southwards for 300m to join Shrine Passage. Northern Doline is the most convenient entrance for access to the East Passage and the Main Streamway. The boulder slope drops down to the stream passage. The stream rises from a large sump and after about 50m disappears down a narrow rift. The large passage continues, in the wet season the stream flows into this passage. On the right there is a complex of rift passage, the Flood Overflow Series, that links via a 4m climb with the upstream end of the Main Streamway. This is the easiest way to reach the streamway. The main passage continues past the Flood Overflow Series, below a couple of 7m pitches from the Main Entrance to become the East Passage. Along East Passage there is a 6m free-climbable pitch down from the end of Shrine Passage and a series of high rifts that have a visual link with Bedding Cave. East Passage eventually becomes a very low, narrow and muddy passage that ends in the Tourist Cave. - The Main Streamway is over 1km long and from Flood Overflow can be followed all the way through to the resurgence. It starts off 5m wide and 10m high, but the height decreases in places and there are a couple of ducks. The passage increases in size as it reaches the pitch at the bottom of Southern High Level. From this pitch the next landmark is the large collapse entrance of Shaft Entrance where the low streamway can be bypassed by clambering over the breakdown. 150m after the Shaft Entrance the stream resurgences into a large pool formed in a collapse feature.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"Tham Takobi is a popular tourist attraction to the north of Umphang and west of Ban Mae Khlong, on the road to Ban Kho Tho. As the road starts to descend after reaching the top of the hill there is a signpost for the cave to the south of the road (the signposts start just south of Mae Sot, over 170km away!). Take this dirt track and turn left after a hundred metres to drive to the parking area, with toilet block, outside the main entrance. Continuing along the dirt track you reach an open area of fields and the track passes between two dolines. The doline to the south of the track (called Northern Doline) involves a scramble down the vegetated boulders. To the north of the track is the main stream sink and an entrance that has been developed into a shrine by the monk who lives here. These two entrances give the easiest access to the streamway. The other entrances are easier to find from inside the cave."

From the Monk's Cave entrance above the monastery some bamboo bridges and ladders aid access to a large dry passage and a second entrance.  After 150m the dry passage meets the Main Passage at a big, boulder floored chamber. - In this chamber the stream drops down some climbs into the Lower Streamway which is a narrow vadose canyon that leads, via some canals, to the Resurgence Entrance.  Just before the resurgence there is a maze of small passages to the east which link up to form the New Streamway series that has the second stream in it.  This ends at an upstream sump. - Back in the junction chamber the large passage heads west.  This is dry, but probably takes water in the height of the wet season.  This now abandoned streamway ends at the Third Entrance.  From the junction chamber the large Main Streamway, 15m wide by 20m high, heads southwards for 200m to where it abruptly turns to the east.  The stream enters from an inlet to the south and bifurcates in the Main Streamway � part of the stream follows this passage to the Lower Streamway while the other half of the stream flows in the opposite direction (seemingly 'uphill') in the Main Streamway before disappearing down a small hole.  This caused confusion for the first explorers who were happy following the stream uphill and then found themselves going downstream. The main stream, now dry, turns south again and after 100m ends at the upstream entrances.   - About 50m to the west of the upper entrances there is another, small, entrance that leads into the Upper Cave.  This is a complex series of vadose streamways and an older dry series that eventually ends in a downstream sump.  This sump is about 100m from the upstream sump in the New Streamway and these two sumps are probably connected.  This Upper Cave is connected by a couple of high level passages to the dry part of the Main Streamway.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"From Umphang don't cross the river on the H1090 towards Ban Pa La Tha, but take the road south of the town that follows the Huai Umphang valley.  After crossing the river on a large concrete bridge and going through a village (the road is unsealed by this point)  a track to the west leads to a monastery.  This track goes through rice paddies and involves driving through a couple of fords and over earth dams.  The main entrance to the cave is about 20m above the monastery.  By continuing along the dirt road up the Huai Umphang valley another track on the right (south) is reached.  This track is fairly rough and goes over a hill to drop down into the valley upstream of the cave.  This is the site of a village that has been moved as it is within the Umphang Wildlife Sanctuary.  Follow the stream to find the main sink with the cave entrances a few metres above and to the north."

Each chamber is defined by a high roof dome and sections of lower roof separate them. The entrance to the cave is made from a collapse doline with a stepped footpath down into the first chamber. Daylight fills most of this room which is very well decorated and contains two shrines. The floor is flat, compacted and sandy with all the small rocks having been cleared to the sides. One wall of this chamber is made of a limestone breccia. At the far end a short slope leads down into the second, third and fourth chambers. These are again flat floored with the smaller rocks having been piled into cairns. High roof domes, up to 30 m, give the cave a feeling of grandeur. Droppings, possibly of serow, are present in the second chamber. - From either the third or fourth chambers a rocky slope climbs up to the fifth chamber. A 20 m pitch enters from the roof and daylight is visible at the top. Continuing up the slope and through a low arch the sixth chamber is reached. The roof has breached the surface 30 m above and daylight floods the room. Small rocks have again been cleared into cairns. A passage at the back of this chamber leads steeply upwards on flowstone and gour pools to a surface collapse doline. The top of the 20 m pitch down into the fifth chamber is seen and a scramble up a gully at the northern end reveals the top of the 30 m shaft entrance to the sixth chamber.  - No bats or wildlife were seen in the cave. Also, archaeological remains are not obvious although no digging was undertaken. Numerous sleeping bunks and walled off alcoves are present within the cave showing that it is used by monks.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"The cave is located on the summit of Khao Khong Chai. The cave is on the western side, but is approached from Wat Pa Nikhom Samakee (on the H3282) on the east. The 1.5 km footpath is rough and it takes about 30 minutes to reach the cave."

The lower one is used for access and the other is 30 m above in the cliff face. Soon after the entrance the cave enlarges dramatically at the intersection of two faults. High in the roof daylight enters from the upper entrance. A fairly flat, sandy floor leads between boulders to a smaller section of passage at two rock columns. Immediately beyond this a large pot has been placed to collect water dripping from the roof. From this point the cave slowly increases in width and height to the final chamber. A short side passage to the right ends after 20 m at a small aven along a joint or fault in the roof.  Walking up the gently rising floor of large boulders, sandy soil and guano reaches the final chamber where a 10 m climb up may lead to a possible high level continuation passage.

This double entrance joins shortly inside the cave at a large boulder floored chamber.  Daylight enters from both the left and right hand ends where the chamber has breached the surface.  Near the right hand entrance to the chamber a small seasonally active streamway can be found amongst large boulders.  This can be followed to the fields on the opposite side of the tower. - To the left side of the main entrance archway a small passage leads off leftwards.  Tis enlarges quickly at another entrance in the roof and a series of connected chambers follow with reasonable decorations.  This part of the cave has been electrically lit in the past.  It also has a small Buddha image near the end and the makings of a concrete trail.  A small group of bats occupies the roof entrance area and a snake was also seen.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"Located to the north of a bend in the track to the Khao Pla Ra ranger station is a small tower.  The tower is riddled with a series of small and large chambers and passages, collectively called Tham Lom.

The chamber contains a large reclining Buddha and numerous other seated Buddhas. White tiles have been used to floor the chamber and create raised worship platforms. Beyond the tiled area, in the second chamber, concrete floors the cave. Much guano is accumulating on the concrete from a small colony of large bats. The concrete descends gently to a flat sandy, silt floor with numerous fossilised teeth.  Porcupine, herbivore (possibly pig) and either bear or tiger have been identified. A low hands and knees crawl at the back of the cave finally becomes too low. Flood water evidently exits the cave via the crawl, but backs up at least to the bottom of the concrete floor. According to the monks the water sometimes forms a large whirlpool and resurges to flood the field on the other side of the tower. - Off the second chamber is a small seasonal inlet passage. The water emerges from a tiny hole at the end of the passage and has built a large series of gour pools.  Also from the second chamber a dangerous wooden ladder leads up to a possible high level passage that was not explored by Smart in 1995.",Martin Ellis,EN,,This is a well established temple cave about 500 m north from the turn off to the Khao Pla Ra ranger station.

Generally the floor sediment is sandy with small rocks. There is a washed out floor level 1 m above the present floor, but insufficient sediment is left to reveal archaeological material. About 20 bats and 5 pigeons roost in the cave. Speleothems are small and uncommon. - Both entrances have been modified with explosives, the second entrance quite drastically. Who did this and for what purpose is unknown.

A small colony of bats lives in the cave. - In itself the cave is not particularly interesting. It is what is revealed on the other side that captures the imagination. By going through the cave a large double doline is found, within the mountain, which is completely invisible from the outside. The dolines are separated by an arch cave and contain a remnant of primary evergreen forest with large trees and ferns, etc. Within the first doline is a collection of aborted buildings, including a toilet block and concrete steps that lead down from the entrance cave to the doline floor.

The main streamway is a mainly large, south to north trending passage with the floor  covered in sand and gravel and in some places the water is deep enough to swim. - The Tham Krachaeng entrance is blocked by gours, with a swim being necessary to get to the gours which can be climbed up and over to regain the stream inside the cave. From here it is easy going in a generally straight passage to the first skylight, with only one side passage that has a floor of mud filled gours to the west which becomes too small after 70 m. At the first skylight there are many guano covered boulders where it is easier to stay at water level to find the way through. The streamway then continues south before looping north. At the point where the loop turns north there is an inlet coming in from the south and this has been followed to where the passage splits into a low crawl and a climb up that is draughting. As the streamway heads north it reduces in size and the noise of the water increases as it approaches a major boulder choke. An awkward climb up of 2 m leads to a squeeze and then the main boulder choke. The fairly solid choke consists of large white marble boulders and it is necessary to climb up through the choke. At the top of the choke there is a chamber filled with flood debris. On other side of the boulder choke the passage heads north for a short distance before looping back round to the south. After a few minutes the junction with Tham Lod is reached. The distance from the resurgence entrance to this junction is 2.8 km. - From the main junction the warm tributary stream can be followed upstream and southwards for nearly 2 km passing a skylight after about 500 m to a boulder choke that has not yet been negotiated. Just before this terminal boulder choke there is a cold water inlet from the east which has been surveyed for just over 100 m, but not completely explored. The source of the warm water inlet is probably Tham Krasaeng.",Martin Ellis,EN,,"Tham Krachaeng is found to the south of the H410 road about 50 km south-west of Yala, near the village of Ban Than To which is halfway between Yala and Betong. The cave is in Khao Tham Krachaeng. The river sink entrance, Tham Lod, is near the Ban Lang National Park. From the entrance to the park headquarters a track on the opposite side of the road, just south of the bridge, leads for 2 km to some houses. From this small village the limestone hill can be seen and is reached by a 10 minute walk downstream or through the cultivated land. The resurgence entrance, Tham Krachaeng, is reached by driving north from Ban Than To for 14 km, through Ban Ka Sod to the 8.47 kilometre marker. Turn right here and follow the track for about 2 km to where the track swings left after some houses and the hill can be seen on the right. The 100 m long Krachaeng Arch Cave is seen immediately and the resurgence is found by walking upstream for a few minutes."
